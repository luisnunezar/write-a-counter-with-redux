# Redux: Write a Counter with Redux
In this lesson, you'll implement a simple counter with Redux from scratch. The basics are provided in the code editor, but you'll have to fill in the details! Use the names that are provided and define incAction and decAction action creators, the counterReducer(), INCREMENT and DECREMENT action types, and finally the Redux store. Once you're finished you should be able to dispatch INCREMENT or DECREMENT actions to increment or decrement the state held in the store. Good luck building your first Redux app!

## Here is my solution:
```
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case INCREMENT:
            return state + 1;

        case DECREMENT:
            return state - 1;

        default:
            return state;
    }
}

const incAction = () => {
    return {
        type: INCREMENT
    }
};

const decAction = () => {
    return {
        type: DECREMENT
    }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer);
```
